Today is the first day of Vietnamese lunar new year. It is national holiday in
Vietnam and is used for marking the start of another spring season.

Last year is such a year for me, professionally. This year I've got some plans
in mind and will try my best to achieve them. Two most challenging things are
to rebuild a big monolith system to microservices and to run a full marathon
in the summer. I'm expected an interesting journey in the end of the year, too.

Wish you all have a successful year ahead!
