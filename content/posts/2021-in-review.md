Another year has come to an end, and now is the time to reflect,
and then start anew. I've made it to the fourth year in a [row][1]
and here are some biggest marks this year.

## I write journals almost every day

I have written journals since 2016, blogs long before that, but only
once in a while. After reading "Educated" by Tara Westover, I've
committed to taking notes of everyday stories to capture the memories
and organize my thoughts. And who knows, someday I might write a memoir
myself!

## I read more non-technical books

Good books are contagious, they make me want to read even more good
books. I mostly read memoirs/biography this year. Now I'm going past
the first thirty-year period of my life, I'm curious about how people
are living or have lived their lives. I might have searched for some
insights and motivation to live the rest of mine.

## I changed job and moved to a new city

It's time for a change, back to what I have longed for, which is to
run alongside the beach, drink a cup of coffee, eat a loaf of bread
and start a new day. I also bought a mountain bike, and ride up to
the mountain in the city each morning. The road is solid, the view is
impressive, and the feeling when riding downhill with both hands in
the sky is doped (don't try that yourself though). Because of that,
despite the COVID situation, I work out more, mostly running and biking.

The new job is satisfying. The team is small and excellent at the same
time. Nothing I would ask for more.

## I earned my first dollars online

It feels good, but I have a long way to go before becoming a true indie
hacker. Building side projects is fun, it has become my recurring action
now and then.

I've learned an attitude some times ago, which states that when your
habit has become a routine to improve yourself, your improvement over
time is inevitable. I guess that's my life's orientation for now.

Let's hope for another year of improvement!
