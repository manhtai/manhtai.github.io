After planing for [12 weeks onto Crypto][0], I've tried to read [the book][1],
but without luck: I don't understand things quite clear, if not nothing at
all. And then I found [this course][2] by Christof Paar, in companion with his
book: [Understanding Cryptography][3]. The course & the book are just
brilliant!

It's very easy to understand hard concepts which are explained by the
professor. The course includes 24 videos, one for each week of study, but
I finish it within 8 weeks. It's extremely intense and I can't say my brain
takes it all, but I've learned so much, some are:

- Symmetric cipher: DES, AES

- Three families of asymmetric cryptography: integer factorization (RSA),
  discrete log (DH, Elgamal) & elliptic curves (ECDH)

- Digital signatures & Hash functions

I've done [some][3] of the problems using Go. I've left out many problems
which are related to calculating the time neccessary to brute-force a cipher,
and some more. That is something I am lack of, basic knowledge about
**Operating System**. It's not just what parts the computer is built from,
it's about how it really works.

So I guess it's 12 weeks more, to dig down in Operating System.

See you then :)
