I have come to coding for almost 4 years now. From the beginning, I was
learning to code for analytics purpose only. I imagined myself become an
analyst that so good at bringing insight about anything which have data.
After that, I built some AI models, one of them is about [searching path][0],
another one is about [NLP][1]. With limited code skills at the moment, I let
myself, for the first time, step into the field of Artificial Intelligence.

4 years have passed. I am from a junior Python web developer, have learned so
many things in the way: backend, frontend, mobile, devops, big data, IoT, data
warehouse. I knew multiple languages, mastered some of them. I used a lot of
frameworks, was good at one or two. There were some jobs that I enjoyed so
much, some I liked lesser. But overall, programming is the kind of work I
love, and it is so lucky for me that I'm paid to do it.

Along the way, I've met many talent people. They all have their own role. And
some role I wished I could do their work. I had to talk with myself that they
were better than me to do the job, and in the mean time, I got better pay for
the job I was doing, so complain no more!

Now is the chance for me to do that. This year, fear no more, I will be back
for [the AI class][2] and finish it one last time. My goal is by next year,
I will become an AI engineer, as advertised.

Wish me luck!
