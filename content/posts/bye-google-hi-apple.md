Since Google [no longer provide][0] G Suite free edition
as from May 2022, I start to migrate all my data from Google
to Apple today.

My most used Google services are Mail, Keep and Photos. The
fact that you can [take out][1] all your Google data makes it
very easy to move into Apple services. After downloading all
your data to your local machine, the next steps are:


## 1. Migrate emails from Gmail to Apple Mail

I use some custom domain emails, so naturally I now use custom
domain for emails in iCloud for that purpose. The [instruction][2]
is straight forward.

To import old emails, I use Mail Mac app to import `mbox` file
which was exported from Google. It will default import emails to your
local Mac, you need to drag and drop it into iCloud tab in order to
sync with other devices.


## 2. Migrate notes from Google Keep to iCloud Drive

Initially I intend to use Apple Notes to replace Google Keep, but
it is not a trivial process. Along the way I discover [Logseq][3] and
immediately feel in love with that.

I use Google Keep mostly to write journals, and Logseq is more than
that, it is a [personal knowledge management system][4] (PKMS), just
like a second brain of yours. The Logseq desktop app is brilliant but
it doesn't have a mobile app yet. Fortunately, we can make [Obsidian][5]
mobile app to play nice with it, all sync up using iCloud drive!

By the way Obsidian itself is another PKMS, I just don't like the way
Obsidian desktop works.


## 3. Migrate photos from Google Photos to Apple Photos

I use Apple Photos Mac app to import photos from exported photos folders
from Google, and then wait for it to sync up to iCloud.
