A year has come to an end, and now is the time to look back.

This year I've learned a lot, run a lot and fail some.

## 1. Coding

I have found new things to learn through all the year, some of them worth
mentioning here are:

**Things I've learned:**

- \- *Go*, then build a [chat app][1]

- \- *Cryptography*, taught by a brilliant [teacher][2]

- \- *Google Cloud Platform*, for work

- \- *Apache Airflow & Apache Beam* for data ingestion (I should write a blog
about these)

- \- *Design patterns* in Java

Go and Java are two more programming languages that are in my belt now, love
to use both of them so far.

**Things I've dropped:**

- \- *Operating System* class

- \- *Computer Vision* class

The first one is too hard, the second one is not attracted me anymore, so I've
decided to quit early.

**Things I am going to learn:**

- \- *MOOC*: Create a programming course in Vietnamese

As you may know, I'm a self-taught developer, hence it will never be enough for
me to learn how to code. But I think it might come the time that I am
certified to reteach what I've learned to those people who just be like me
when I was started. Hope I will learn new things along the way, too.
[techcamp.vn][4] is registered and ready to go live. Wait for it!

- \- *Microservices*: Building microservices in Go and Java

I've build many monolith applications and none of microservices, so I will try
to build one next year.


## 2. Running

I love running. This year I've completed 2 full marathons, one in Danang and
another one in Hanoi. I've trained hard for the first one, not too hard for
the second, because I found out that Hanoi's air quality is extremely bad for
your health. Now I only go to run when [AQI][3] is bad for sensitive people
group (!?) or lower.

I don't have much hope for improvement of air quality in Hanoi next year, so
I may not keep the record up. I really feel bad about this.

## 3. Reading

I read technical books a lot, I've subscribed to [Safaribooksonline][5] so
I can read as many books as I want. Video tutorials are quite good, too.

Some none technical books I've read this year include "Sapiens: A Brief
History of Humankind", "Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the
Future", and some that I can't remember.

Next year I will keep track of all none technical books I read in Goodreads so
I will have some things to write in the year end post.


2018 is a satisfied year for me. More chances in 2019 for me to explore. Can't
wait!
