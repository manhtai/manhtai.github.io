      <description>&lt;p&gt;Turn out Celery has &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/celery/celery/issues/1427&#34;&gt;some memory leaks&lt;/a&gt;. We don&amp;rsquo;t know that beforehand.
After deploying some Celery servers using AWS ECS we notice that all Celery
tasks will consume most of the server memory and then become idle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first attempt was set &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html&#34;&gt;hard limit&lt;/a&gt; for container memory to 1GiB. And
guess what? Celery will consume 99.9% of that limit then become idle after
some times. It&amp;rsquo;s good for the server but doesn&amp;rsquo;t solve our problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second attempt was set &lt;code&gt;CELERYD_TASK_TIME_LIMIT&lt;/code&gt; to 300, so celery tasks
will be killed after 5 minutes no matter what. This time Celery continue to
take memory percentage as much as it can and then become inactive, but after
5 minutes it kills all the tasks to release memory and then back to work
normally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t say I&amp;rsquo;m satisfied with this solution, but it works for now. Till next
time.&lt;/p&gt;
